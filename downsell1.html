              <h4 class="sell-text-center">You Can Still Secure A HUGE Discount on Gluco20. But With 4 Additional Bottles Instead Of 8</h4>
              <em>(Keep reading for all the details...)</em>
              <p>Dear Friend…</p>
              <p>I understand that 8 additional bottles may not be what you had in mind. But I also know that some things are worth fighting for.</p>
              <p>I’ve seen first hand just how life-changing Gluco20 can be.</p>
              <p>And how it’s the perfect supplement to not only take personally…</p>
              <p>But to also share with your family, friends, and other loved ones.</p>
              <p>Because the ingredients inside Gluco20 are sourced from specific, hard-to-reach locations…</p>
              <em>And come from all over the world…</em>
              <p>It takes considerable amounts of time, energy, and money to manufacture every bottle.</p>
              <p>As a result, <strong>out of stocks happen all too frequently…</strong></p>
              <p>Which is why I want to give you one more chance to secure an additional 4 bottles of Gluco20.</p>
              <p>Remember, to get the absolute best results with Gluco20, you need to use it every single day, like a multi-vitamin.</p>
              <p>But Gluco20 is not available in any retail stores. And I don’t want you to experience life-changing improvements , and then find you can’t get any more.</p>
              <p>That’s why on this private page only…</p>
              <p><strong>You can stock up on Gluco20 by adding 4 BOTTLES to your order for just $116.</strong></p>
              <p>That’s just $29 a bottle, or just $0.48 per pill. It’s also a total savings of <strong>$440 off the normal retail price.</strong></p>
              <p>Plus we’ll also cover the added shipping for FREE.</p>
